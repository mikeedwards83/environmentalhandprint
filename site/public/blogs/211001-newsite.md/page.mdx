## Welcome to our new site!

We are really excited to announce our new site to  discuss all things environmental, including the environmental handprint!

We want to create a place which celebrate all the positive actions people are taking around the world to help our planet
and drive a conversation about where we are going and how we get there.

We hope that with a positive metaphor which encourages and rewards us for making positive environmental changes we can motiviate
more people to get involved.

Our community is small at the moment but we would love it if you became part of it!

Please follow us on social media and share this site with your friends and starting asking the people you meeting "How big is your handprint?".

Thanks 

The Handprint Community
