Black Friday, it happens the first Friday after Thanksgiving in the USA, and with scenes of chaos as shoppers charge and fight with each other to get a 
discount on everything from electronics to clothing and more.

In recent years Black Friday has been followed by Cyber Monday, a day when online retailers offer large discounts on products and services. Similar to Black Friday but with (hopefully) less fights and stampeding.
Over the last few years we have seen Black Friday and Cyber Monday heading around the world. 

## So what‚Äôs the problem?

The problem with Black Friday is that it can drive overconsumption. There is some debate about this and [Sustainababble has a great podcast](http://www.sustainababble.fish/?p=1422) trying to answer this question.

Their conclusion was that it maybe didn‚Äôt matter as much as we think, how I would argue that if discounts didn‚Äôt drive over consumption then why offer them? If a discount doesn‚Äôt drive additional revenue and unit sales then why would a business off them? 

I know myself that I have been caught by the site of a large discount on something and thought, ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt need it now, but it is on discount, so I will get it just in case‚Äù. 
Where discounts are offered on high volume, low cost items such as fast fashion items, buyers may think:

‚ÄúWith that discount I could by two‚Äù
‚ÄúIt costs less than ¬£10 with the discount, so why not‚Äù

There is an argument that Black Friday discounts are often offered on old stock that isn‚Äôt being purchased, and if it was sold would be thrown away by the company. Therefore by offering a discount and selling it, then these products don‚Äôt end up in landfill. The problem with this argument is that each year we have Black Friday, so each year we overproduce and have more items that we don‚Äôt want to end up at landfill which we now need to discount. Black Friday doesn‚Äôt break the circle of overproduction, in many ways it may even reinforce it, because it inflates the number of units sold which may mean ordering departs over order the following year.

## --Black-- Green Friday

Ok, enough of me moaning about the problem, what could be the solution or an alternative?

What if, instead of Black Friday we had a Green Friday. On Green Friday instead of offering a discount to the consumer a company takes the same discount amount and dedicates it to an environmental project.

For example, maybe an electronics company would normally offer a 40% discount on a television. Instead of giving the 40% discount to the customer, on Green Friday, that 40% will be donated to tackling [e-waste pollution](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-06-2021-soaring-e-waste-affects-the-health-of-millions-of-children-who-warns).

Or maybe, instead of offering two dresses for the price on one (the classic BOGOF), the fashion brand could donate the cost of the second dress to [cleaning up](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/07/fast-fashion-speeding-toward-environmental-disaster-report-warns) the waste produced by the fashion industry.
## Small Benefits For Everyone

The nice thing about Green Friday is that it benefits everyone in different ways. 

For the companies offering an ‚ÄúEnvironmental Discount‚Äù they can still run their normal marketing campaigns and at the same time grow their Handprint üñê. Local companies could support local environmental initiatives, large companies can donate to organisations that might mitigate some of the damage of production.

For you and me as customer's, we can buy the things we need and know that each purchase we make will go to help the planet in a small way. However we aren‚Äôt encouraged to overconsume, to buy things that we don‚Äôt need, meaning more money in your pocket.

For environmental NGOs they can find new partners and raise awareness of their work and raise additional funds.

And maybe for producers we can send a signal back up about what the real demand is and reduce overproduction.


What are your thoughts? Would your company join Green Friday? Would you be more likely to buy something on Green Friday if it helped the planet?

Let us know on social media.
