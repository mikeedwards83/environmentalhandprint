## Discovering my handprint üñê?

I was really excited when I came across the term Environmental Handprint! I was used to hearing terms 
like carbon footprint, greenhouse gases but I hadn‚Äôt ever heard of a term that describes all the 
positive things I was doing for the planet. 

When I came across the handprint idea, a lightbulb üí° went on in my head. SUDDENLY I now had a way 
to visualise all the positive actions I was taking to help the planet and a way to ask people about 
all the good things they were doing.

## How big is your handprint?

Now I can ask myself ‚ÄúHow can I make my handprint just a little bit bigger today?‚Äù, i.e. what small 
positive act can I do today to help the planet? This could be anything from reusing a water bottle 
to something much larger like having a meat free meal. With each of these actions I could see my handprint grow a little bit bigger.

I have slightly fallen in love ‚ù§ with the idea of the handprint, so I have written a small article 
about how individuals and companies can use it to empower them to make a positive change.
