Our daily lives are full of stats, numbers and trackers, for example the number of steps we need to take each day to something more complicated such as the recommended number of calories we should eat each day.

In  this post I want to look at why I think the Environmental Handprint is need and how it can help us change how we think about tackling the climate crisis.
Within the environmental space there are already many stats about our individual impacts on the planet, for example:
•	Carbon footprint
•	Plastic footprint
•	Kgs waste sent to Landfill

These stats are useful for our understanding about our own impact and how it contributes to the global environmental crisis. Without knowing about the extent of the damage we are doing we can’t start working towards a solution.
However, each of these stats focuses on the negative impacts we are having, and an indication of our bad behaviour. Unfortunately, we don’t really have a positive stat or metaphor. 
To reduce these measurements, we must stop doing something we enjoy, this could be eating meat, going on vacation, or not buying a particular product. As a result, we might be reluctant to stop these actions because they are enjoyable actions, and the only reward for cutting these out is the reduction of a negative stat.

So, we must stop doing something we like doing (a negative action) to reduce a stat that is that itself a negative. For many this probably doesn’t feel very rewarding because at no point have we focused on the positive outcome.

# A Positive Conversation

What changes if we introduce the Environmental Handprint?
The idea of the Environmental Handprint is to provide a metaphor and mechanism that can be used to highlight the positive impact of the actions taken.

For example, an individual may have decide to not fly on holiday this year. In the past they might have said:
“I have not flown the year which has reduced my Carbon Footprint by 2 tonnes.”
With the handprint this changes to:
“ I have grown my Environmental Handprint by not flying on holiday this  year.”
The difference maybe subtle, and you may think, does this matter? But I think that this small change allows individuals to get a small sense of reward for their action.
The Handprint also rewards you for smaller actions, you might see a piece of litter on the floor and think:
“If pick it up and put it in the bin then that will grow my Environmental Handprint.”
This small positive psychological boost will hopefully reinforce positive behaviour.

# Summary
This blog post is a short explanation of how I think the Handprint can help by rewarding people with a small positive reinforcement of the actions they are taking.
By having a metaphor that encapsulates all the positive actions that an individual takes, small or large, they can visualise and focus on growing their Handprint and always increasing their positive impact.
