## Welcome to our new site!

We are really excited to announce the launch of our new site about  everything environmental handprint and the environment.

We wanted to create a place which celebrates the positive actions people are taking around the world to help our planet
and drive a conversation about where we are going and how we get there.

We hope that with a positive metaphor, Environmental Handprint, we can encourage and reward people for making positive environmental changes and motivate
more people to get involved.

## But why a Handprint üñê?

Most of us are used to hearing terms such as carbon footprint, greenhouse gases, the planet is a patient.

However we didn't have a common way to describe quick and easily  all the positive actions that we take to help our planet.

Then we found the metaphor, Environmental Handprint, a beautiful and easy way to describe how we are helping th planet.
From reducing our carbon footprint and supporting environmental charities to reducing our plastic usage and shopping locally; we now have a
a great way to talk about all of these at the same time.

Each time we perform one of these actions we are adding to our individual Handprints and making the world a little better.

## What do you need to do?

What we want you to do is **free**, just start using the term Environmental Handprint and begin
a positive conversation about saving our planet.

A conversation that encourages people to take action by positively reinforcing these actions.

And every time that you take an action, remind yourself that you are adding to your Handprint and potentially the Handprint of others.

Also it would be great if you can follow us on social media. üòâ

## What is next?

Over the next few months we will be expanding the information we have on the site about the Environmental Handprint and celebrating the
positive contributions people are making as well as ways that you can make a difference.

We would also love to hear from you if you want to contribute to the project. It is currently being run by a team of volunteers and we would love
to grow our community and have more people on board.


Thanks

Mike & The Handprint Community
