                <li>Notwithstanding the security measures that We take, it is important to remember that the

                    as prospective investors, affiliates, partners and advertisers. Data will only be shared and used
                    within the bounds of the law.</li>
                <li>In certain circumstances We may be legally required to share certain data held by Us, which may
