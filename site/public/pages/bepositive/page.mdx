In this page you will find a whole set of positive environmental terms the team has discovered, as well as ideas which will help you grow you Handprint. 

We want you suggestions and ideas well, so if we are missing a term or you have invented a new one, share it with us so we can add to the list.

## Circular Economy

The Circular Economy refers to how we can create an economic system that produces no waste products. When a product gets to the end of its life it is repaired or turned into something new. The aim is to send nothing to landfill. A great read to learn more is **Welcome to the Circular Economy** by <a href="https://twitter.com/ClairePotter" target="_blank">Claire Potter</a>.

## Rebugging 

This term comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/vickihird" target="_blank">Vicki Hird</a> and her  book **Rebugging The Planet**, which discusses why insects are so important (spoiler we can't live without them) to our eco-system and what we can do to increase insect numbers.
